    <p>Repair & Share Foyle is a Community Interest Company dedicated to tackling waste through community repair. We believe in the power of communities to address the climate emergency by coming together to share time, skills, and resources.</p>
    <p>We have an active pop-up ‘Repair Café Foyle’, and we are currently mapping out a ‘Library of Things Foyle’, where residents can hire anything from a carpet cleaner to a hand drill!</p>
    <p>This sharing economy model saves people time, money, and space and challenges a linear economy - where we take, make, use, and dispose of the ‘things’ we consume in everyday life.</p>
    <p>Please get in touch if you are interested to learn more or want to collaborate.</p>
